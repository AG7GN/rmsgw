# /etc/ax25/axports
#
# Use simple descriptive names for the ports, to make debugging 
# other associated software easier.
#
# Callsign is the callsign attached to the ax port with ifconfig. Use
# the L2 callsign of the port here.
#
# Speed is serial line speed between the computer and the TNC
# NOT the over-the-air baud rate.
#
# Paclen is the maximum packet length to send. When paclen bytes are ready, 
# a packet is automatically sent. 
#
# The maximum is 256. Try this on user ports with good quality links. You 
# may find that reducing this number as low as 128 helps on RF links. 
#
# For trunks (link) between nodes, the maximum should be 253 (because of 
# protocol overhead, ie ROSE uses 3 bytes). Again, reduce this number on 
# lower quality links to reduce the number of retries.
# 
# On HF (300 baud), use a setting of 32.
#
# Window size is the same as the MAXFRAME setting in many TNC's. It is
# the number of frames to send in a transmission without an ACK. Maximum 
# is 7, use smaller numbers for poor quality or RF links. 
#
# On VHF/UHF you should be able to use a setting of 4 with good results.
#
# On HF you will want to use 2 or 1.
#
# The description field will be shown when programs query information 
# about the port, use something descriptive about the port for users.
